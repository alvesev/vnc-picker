This program intended to assist in connecting to a VNC server over
SSH tunnel.

This utility was inspired by russian publication: Graphical terminal
server - secured remote desktop access with session keeping in case of
disconnect - http://help.ubuntu.ru/wiki/tightvnc-ssh-terminal-server
(Графический сервер терминалов - защищённый удалённый вход, без потери
информации в случае последующего разрыва).
