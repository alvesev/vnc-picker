How to do it from scratch.

Generate template files:

        dh_make --yes --createorig --single --packagename package-name_0.1

Edit files:

        debian/control
        debian/changelog
        debian/copyright
        debian/rules
        and may be other files

Generate package (it will not be signed with PGP):

        dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc

The packages to be generated are stored in the build directory tree. One may google out the discussion on where they are stired. May be there is a sence to do:

        mv --force "../package-name_0.1_amd64.deb" "."
        mv --force "../package-name_0.1_amd64.changes" "."

Or so:
        mv --force "./package-name_0.1_amd64.deb" ".."
        mv --force "./package-name_0.1_amd64.changes" ".."

Do cleanup:

        make clean

Check the files are on board:

        dpkg -c package-name_0.1_amd64.deb

One may do:

    fakeroot ./do-it-to-create-the-package.sh
